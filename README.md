This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The purpose is to keep track of books you've read so you don't forget about them, especially if you want to reread them in the future.

The app is divided into three parts:

1. Form: To add a book to your library.
2. Library: Displays your collection with various filtering options.
3. Book Details: Provides detailed information about each book.
4. 
The app supports user separation, so you only see your own books and not the entire database.
